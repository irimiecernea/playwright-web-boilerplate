`--project=foobar` -> where foobar is the browser on which you want to run your tests (e.g. `chromium`, `firefox`, etc.). Please refer to [this](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers) documentation for more information.

Please note that Playwright supports several flags when running tests, such as `--workers`, `--debug`, etc. Please check the official documentation if you want to customise your command further.
